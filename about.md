# Who's <code>gvdr</code>?

I am Giulio Valentino Dalla Riva: a PhD @ [Biomathematics Research Centre](http://www.math.canterbury.ac.nz/bio/), [University of Canterbury](http://www.canterbury.ac.nz/), working with [Mike Steel](http://www.math.canterbury.ac.nz/~m.steel/) and [Daniel Stouffer](http://www.stoufferlab.org/people/stouffer/) and his wonderful [crew](http://www.stoufferlab.org).

I'm a biomathematician. That's like a theoretical ecologists who knows much less biology and (hopefully) a bit more maths. I use mathematics to explore the interaction between ecological and evolutionary processes. My research themes include food webs and food-web motifs---in particular their evolution---, phylogenetics and models of evolution.

My work is funded by the [Allan Wilson](http://www.allanwilsoncentre.ac.nz/massey/learning/departments/centres-research/allan-wilson-centre/about-us/allan-wilson.cfm) [Centre for Molecular Ecology and Evolution](http://www.allanwilsoncentre.ac.nz).
