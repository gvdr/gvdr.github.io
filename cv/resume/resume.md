Research Interests:
----------

*EcoEvo*

:   **Food webs**; Food webs assembly and dynamics; their response to anthropic pressure; the role of species interactions in ecosystems and their drivers.

:   **Phylogenetics**; Evolutionary models and their possible extension to handle the effects of species interaction: ecology-aware phylogenetics analysis.

:   **Network evolution** The origin, evolution and dismantling of ecological networks; the effect of speciation/extinction events on ecosystems.

*Networks*

:   **Local/Global properties**; The connection between local and global network properties, such as centralities, motifs, dynamical stability.

*Maths*
:   Phylogenetic Comparative Methods; Dynamical processes on and of Complex Networks; Networks statistical modelling and analysis; Random Matrices.
