# Why am I here?

What does online publishing have to do with the digital humanities?

##

> "... the true power of the digital humanities ... has nothing to do with **production** of either tools or research. The heart of the digital humanities is not the production of knowledge; it's the **reproduction** of knowledge."

[Mark Sample](http://www.samplereality.com/2011/05/25/the-digital-humanities-is-not-about-building-its-about-sharing/)

<p class="fragment">Is there a distinctive DH approach to publishing?</p>

<section>
As humanists, we already consume online publications ...

... and find ourselves published online.

## Already ...

- Colleagues are looking online to discover our work; ["Google is the first port of call."](http://www.sr.ithaka.org/research-publications/supporting-changing-research-practices-historians)
- Our publications are often excerpted on Google Books.
- Our conferences are often live-tweeted (e.g., [AHA 2013](http://thebroadside.org/tw-archives/aha2013.php); [MLA 2013](http://hashtag.mla13.org)) and [blogged](http://digitalhumanitiesnow.org/2013/01/editors-choice-aha2013-and-mla13-roundup/).
- Our universities are adopting [open-access policies](http://library.rice.edu/about/admin_org/press-publications/news-from-fondren-html/volume-21-no.-2-volume-22-no.-1-spring-fall-2012/fondren-supports-faculty-open-access-policy) for faculty.
- We will ...

<h3 class="fragment grow">Publish or be published.</p>

## The question is ...

**not** whether we *will* publish online but *how* and *on what terms*.

### Online publishing raises questions about:

1. Access and economics
2. Gatekeeping and peer review
3. Scholarly collaboration

### Online publishing can be ...

open *or* closed, post-print *or* pre-print, reviewed before publication *or* reviewed after.

#

## Reasons for Openness

... they're not just for DHers.

##

> "The largest hidden cost is the invisibility of what you publish. When you publish somewhere that is behind gates, or in paper only, you are resigning all of that hard work to invisibility in the age of the open web. You may reach a few peers in your field, but you miss out on the broader dissemination of your work, including to potential other fans."

[Dan Cohen](http://www.dancohen.org/2010/05/27/open-access-publishing-and-scholarly-values/)

##

> "The simplest analysis of the 'crisis in scholarly publishing' is that it’s a problem of audience ..."

[John Unsworth](http://www.digitalculture.org/hacking-the-academy/hacking-scholarship/#scholarship-unsworth)

Policies may already be more open than you think.

Examples of online publishing in non-DH fields:

- [Society for U.S. Intellectual History](http://s-usih.org)
- [Religion in American History](http://usreligion.blogspot.com)
- [Journal of Southern Religion](http://jsr.fsu.edu)
- [The Junto](http://earlyamericanists.com)
- [In the Middle](http://www.inthemedievalmiddle.com)

#

## Reasons for Openness

... the DH Manifesto version.

##

> "We call for open access to data and metadata, which must be documented and interoperable, both technically and conceptually. We support the dissemination, exchange and free modification of methods, code, formats and research findings."

[Manifesto for the Digital Humanities](http://tcp.hypotheses.org/411)

##

> "Open is a  willingness to share, not only resources, but processes, ideas, thoughts, ways of thinking and operating. Open means working in spaces and places that are transparent and allow others to see what you are doing and how you are doing it, giving rise to opportunities for people who could help you to connect with you, jump in and offer that help. And where you can reciprocate and do the same."

[Clint Lalonde](http://clintlalonde.net/2012/10/18/open-is-a-noun-verb-adjective-and-an-attitude/)

##

> "The digital humanities community embraces openness because of both self-interest and ethical aspirations. In order to create digital scholarship, researchers typically need access to data, tools, and dissemination platforms. ... Openness [also] supports related values such as transdisciplinarity, collaboration, and the democratization of knowledge."

[Lisa Spiro](http://dhdebates.gc.cuny.edu/debates/text/13)

# Is this Utopian?

![<http://theopenutopia.org>](./img/openutopia.png)

#

> "... the problem of open access isn’t just about the ethics of freeing and sharing scholarly information. It’s as much — if not more — about the psychology and incentives around scholarly publishing. We need to think these issues through much more deeply to make open access widespread."

[Dan Cohen](http://www.wired.com/opinion/2013/01/we-need-more-than-releasing-articles-to-make-open-access-work/)

## Digital Humanists are Rethinking:

- Peer review processes
- Funding models
- Discovery tools
- Publishing platforms
- Genre conventions
