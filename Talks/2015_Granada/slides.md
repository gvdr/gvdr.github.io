# Evolution in/of Ecology

Evolution shaped the stochastic backbones of Food Webs

## Phylogenetic vs. Observed traits

vcv(X_e|evolutionary model) ~ vcv(X)

# More questions (than answers)
* There actually is phylogenetic signal
* It is (quite) weak
* It saturates with dimensionality
* Fine wirings may be deceiving
* Null model is inadequate

# (Not a) Conclusion
Spoiler 1: Evolutionary distinctiveness vs. Web Centrality

Spoiler 2: An ecological informed model of species evolution maybe it's (almost) there.

# Thanks!

P.S. I am looking for a research team where to develop further this picture. Contact me if interested: gvd16@uclive.ac.nz
