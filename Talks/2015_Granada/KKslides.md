# Evolution in/of Ecology

Evolution shaped the stochastic backbones of Food Webs

## Phylogenetic vs. Observed traits

\begin{equation*}
vcv\left( \hat{X} | \mbox{ evolutionary model} \right) \mbox{ vs. } vcv\left(X\right)
\end{equation*}

# More questions (than answers)

* There is phylogenetic signal
* It is quite weak
* It saturates with dimensionality
* Fine wirings may be deceiving
* Evolutionary model is inadequate

# (Not a) Conclusion

* Spoiler 1: Evolutionary distinctiveness vs. Web Centrality

* Spoiler 2: An ecological informed model of species evolution maybe it's (almost) there.

# Thanks!
